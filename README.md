# CURD_Application_Using_Node
This website will be used as a referal in the future and this app developed by  Node Js and MongoDB
This is a normal CURD application which I developed for reference for the further developement
This CURD application generally supports the image upload facility .

Hit the command npm i in terminal to install all the packages related to this project.

Hit npm run dev to run the project in localhost.

I used mongoDB atlas as a Database in this project.

So connect with your mongoDB atlas url to run the project .
